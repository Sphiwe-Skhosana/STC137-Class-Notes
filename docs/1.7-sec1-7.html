<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.7</span> Data analysis – Foundations and Concepts</h2>
<p>Data analysis is the process of systematically using statistical techniques to explore, clean, transform and model data with the purpose of discovering useful information which can then be used to support decision-making.</p>
<div id="the-data-analysis-process" class="section level3" number="1.7.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.7.1</span> The Data Analysis process</h3>
<p>Data analysis can be viewed as a sequence of steps combining some of the data literacy skills we have already discussed so far in this book. This process can be summarized as follows:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>Define the study</strong></p>
<p>The first and important step in the data analysis process is to clearly define the problem that the analysis aims to address by stating the objectives and specific questions that the analysis aims to answer.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Data collection</strong></p>
<p>Once the study is defined, the next step is to collect the relevant data. This can be done using various methods to be discussed in Chapter <a href="3-ch3.html#ch3">3</a>. The choice of method used to collect data depends on the nature of the problem and the questions being asked.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Data cleaning</strong></p>
<p>After collecting the data, the next step is to clean the data. This involves identifying and rectify errors, missing values and inconsistencies in the data. Data cleaning will be further discussed and practically demonstrated in Chapter <a href="2-ch2.html#ch2">2</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The second and third step are part of data management. See Section <a href="1.3-sec1-3.html#sec1-3">1.3</a> for more details.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Data exploration</strong></p>
<p>After cleaning the data, we conduct a preliminary analysis to understand the characteristics of the data. See Section <a href="1.5-sec1-5.html#sec1-5">1.5</a> for more details on how this is done in practice.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Data transformation</strong></p>
<p>Following from the results of the exploration phase of the data analysis, the data is prepared for analysis by encoding categorical variables, scaling (normalizing or standardizing) some numerical variables and, if necessary, handling outliers.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Data modelling (analysis)</strong></p>
<p>Now the data is ready for the actual analysis. This step involves using statistical and mathematical techniques on the data to discover patterns, relationships, similarities or trends.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Interpretation and visualization</strong></p>
<p>After the data analysis, the next step is to interpret the obtained results and present them in a manner that can be easily understood. This can be done through visualization.</p></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="approaches-to-data-analysis" class="section level3" number="1.7.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.7.2</span> Approaches to Data Analysis</h3>
<p>There are different types of data analysis and each one serves a unique purpose. The choice of which one to use will depend on the nature of your study and what kind of questions you seek to answer.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Descriptive analysis</strong> is used to describe and summarize the collected data to understand what happened in the past. For example, a university might use descriptive analysis to find out how many first-year students passed last year.</li>
<li><strong>Diagnostic analysis</strong> follows descriptive analysis by going a step further to explain or diagnose why something happened. For example, suppose the number of first years that passed last year dropped significantly, diagnostic analysis can be used to find out why this happened.</li>
<li><strong>Predictive analysis</strong> is used to forecast or predict what might happen in the future based on historical data. For example, a university can use predictive analysis to predict the number of first-year students that will pass next year. In other words, based on what has happened in the past we can find out what could happen in the future.</li>
<li><strong>Prescriptive analysis</strong> is used to make recommendations on what course of action to take in order to reach a desired outcome. For example, suppose a university wants to increase the pass rate for first-year students, a prescriptive analysis might suggest the best course of action towards reaching this outcome.</li>
</ol>

<div id="uses-of-data-analysis-in-modern-society" class="section level3" number="1.7.3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.7.3</span> Uses of data analysis in modern society</h3>
<p>Data analysis is a very important data literacy skill that finds application across various fields and domains of application such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Marketing research</strong>, where it can be used to assist businesses to understand market trends, consumer preferences and help identify opportunities for product development.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Medical diagnosis</strong>, where it can be used to interpret medical images (e.g. MRI scans) and also assist in early detection of a disease.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Medical drug discovery</strong>, where it is used by pharmaceutical companies, such as Johnson and Johnson, to develop a drug by conducting clinical trials and testing the effectiveness of the drug.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Fraud detection</strong>, where it can be use by banks to identify unusual transaction patterns and detect fraudulent activities.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Risk management</strong>, where it is used by financial services companies to assess a client’s credit risk (i.e. will they be able to pay back the loan) and model risks in the forex market or stock market.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Quality control</strong>, where it is used to monitor and control the quality of products on the production line.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Social science research</strong>, where it is used to analyze survey data to study overall human behavior and sentiment.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Recommendation systems</strong>, where it used by platforms such as Spotify and Netflix to recommend music or shows that you might like based on the content that you viewed in the past.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Environmental monitoring</strong>, where geographical (remote sensing) data is used to monitor ecological changes such as deforestation, water quality and air pollution.</p></li>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.7.4</span> Data analysis techniques</h3>
<p>There are many techniques used in data analysis and each one serves a unique purpose and application. In section [Data exploration], we discussed data exploration. This is the most basic technique for data analysis. In this section, we will briefly discuss some of the most commonly used and emerging techniques.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>Correlation analysis</strong></p>
<p>Correlation analysis is a technique used to understand the linear relationship between two or more numerical variables. A simple measure that is commonly used to describe this relationship is the <strong>correlation coefficient</strong>, usually denoted by <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>. The correlation coefficient is used to quantify the strength of the linear relationship between two numerical variables. The value of <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> will always lies between <span class="math inline">\(-1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>. Values close to <span class="math inline">\(-1\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(+1\)</span> indicate a strong linear relationship. The closer the value of <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> is to zero, say less than 0.5 or more than -0.5, the weaker the linear relationship. As an example of the use of the correlation coefficient, suppose we want to know the strength of the relationship between a student’s matric final mark and their final mark at the end of their first-year of study at a university. Given a correlation coefficient of <span class="math inline">\(r=0.93\)</span>, we can say that there is a strong positive linear relationship between a student’s matric final mark and their first-year final mark. In other words, a larger final matric mark is strongly associated with a larger first-year final mark. Finally, please note that correlation measures the linear association between two numerical variables and not necessarily causality. In other words, a high correlation between two variables does not mean changes in one variable will cause changes in the other variable.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Regression analysis</strong></p>
<p>Regression analysis is a statistical technique used to understand the dependence of one variable, known as a dependent variable, on one or more other variables, known as independent variables. It is commonly used for predictive analysis. A simple and widely applicable approach to regression analysis is the least squares line. Consider two numerical variables <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> which are assumed to follow a straight line pattern. The relationship between <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> can be described using a straight line given by the equation</p></li>
</ol>
<p><span class="math display" id="eq:eq1">\[\begin{equation}
y=A+Bx \tag{1.1}                                            
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> is the dependent variable, assumed to depend on <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> known as the independent variable. The term <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is the y-intercept and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> is the slope which represents an increase in <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> for every unit-increase in <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>. For a given sample of <span class="math inline">\((x,y)\)</span> points, we can obtain an estimate of <a href="1.7-sec1-7.html#eq:eq1">(1.1)</a>, given by,</p>
<p><span class="math display" id="eq:eq2">\[\begin{equation}
\hat{y}=a+bx \tag{1.2}                                          
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> are estimates of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>, respectively, obtained by the method of least squares. Hence, equation <a href="1.7-sec1-7.html#eq:eq2">(1.2)</a> is known as the least-squares regression line.</p>
<p>Equation <a href="1.7-sec1-7.html#eq:eq2">(1.2)</a> can be used to:</p>
<ul>
<li>describe the dependence of <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> allowing us to learn more about the process that produces <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>.</li>
<li>comment on the type of linear pattern between <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> (whether its positive, <span class="math inline">\(b&gt;0\)</span>, negative, <span class="math inline">\(b&lt;0\)</span>, or no pattern exists, <span class="math inline">\(b=0\)</span>).</li>
<li>measure the influence that <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> has on <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> based on the magnitude of the value of <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>.</li>
<li>predict the future value of <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> for a given value of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>As an example of the use of the least-squares line for regression analysis, consider the least squares line <span class="math inline">\(\hat{y}=60+5x\)</span> estimated to a data set on student population (in 1000s), <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, and quarterly pizza sales (R 1000s), <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, for a sample of 10 restaurants located near university campuses. The following points can be made about the fitted least-squares line:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(b=5&gt;0\)</span> which implies that as student population, <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, increases, quarterly sales increase.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(a=60\)</span>, which means for a restaurant that is not located close to a university (that is, <span class="math inline">\(x=0\)</span>), the quarterly sales are <span class="math inline">\(R60000\)</span>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Lastly, we can use the least-squares line to predict the quarterly sales for a given size of the student population. For <span class="math inline">\(x=16\)</span>, representing 16000 students, the quarterly sales are predicted to be <span class="math inline">\(\hat{y}=60+5(16)=140\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(R140000\)</span>.</p>

<li><p><strong>Cluster analysis</strong></p>
<p>Cluster analysis is used to group a set of objects or entities in such a way that objects in the same group (or cluster) are more similar than those in other clusters. It is commonly used in recommendation systems and market research to find consumers with similar preferences.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Dimension reduction</strong></p>
<p>As implied by the name, this technique is used to reduce a large number of variables into few variables in such a way that the remaining variables capture the maximum possible information from the original variables. It is commonly used in conjunction with some of the already-mentioned techniques such as cluster analysis for medical diagnosis.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Hypothesis testing</strong></p>
<p>This technique is used to make inference or statements about population characteristics (such as the mean) using sample data. It is commonly used in the control and monitoring of quality in a production process.</p></li>
